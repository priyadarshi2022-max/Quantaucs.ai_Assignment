# 📧 Email Marketing Campaign Optimization with Machine Learning

## 🔍 Overview

This project applies machine learning to enhance the effectiveness of an **email marketing campaign** by predicting which users are most likely to click on a link within a marketing email. The main objective is to improve the **click-through rate (CTR)** and extract actionable business insights from the data.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

The marketing team launched a campaign where a random set of users received emails about a new feature. The success metric is whether users **clicked the link** in the email. This project addresses:

1. **Campaign performance evaluation** (open rate, CTR).
2. **Click prediction modeling** using LightGBM.
3. **CTR uplift estimation** using model-driven targeting.
4. **User segmentation insights**.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains three key tables:

- **email_table.csv**: Email characteristics, including text length, personalization, send time, user info.
- **email_opened_table.csv**: IDs of opened emails.
- **link_clicked_table.csv**: IDs of emails with a clicked link.

## 📈 Campaign Engagement Metrics

| Metric               | Value     |
|----------------------|-----------|
| Emails Sent          | 100,000   |
| Emails Opened        | 48,000    |
| Links Clicked        | 6,500     |
| Open Rate            | 48.0%     |
| Click-Through Rate   | 6.5%      |
| Click-to-Open Ratio  | 13.5%     |

## 🧠 Machine Learning Pipeline

- **Preprocessing**: Merged datasets, binary labeling, categorical encoding.
- **Balancing**: SMOTE + class weighting due to class imbalance.
- **Modeling**: LightGBM classifier with hyperparameter tuning.
- **Validation**: 10-Fold cross-validation + final validation/test splits.
- **Evaluation**: Precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

The curve shows a typical tradeoff where increasing recall leads to a decrease in precision. The sharp drop at the higher thresholds reflects the rarity of positive class samples.

## 🚀 CTR Uplift Estimation
